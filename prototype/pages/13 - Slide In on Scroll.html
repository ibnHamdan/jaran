    <p>Dependency injection is a variant of the Inversion of
         Control design pattern. Dependency injection containers
          reduce the dependency coupling between objects by providing
           a facility to instantiate instances of classes and
            manage their lifetimes based on the con-  
            guration of the container. During the creation 
            of objects, the container injects into the object
             any dependencies the object requires.
              If those dependencies have not yet been created,
               the container creates and resolves
                their dependencies  rst.</p>
